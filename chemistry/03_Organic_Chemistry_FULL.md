# ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
## The Mechanism of Stability — Electrons Seeking Rest

---

## PAGE 1 — The Core Insight

Organic Chemistry is **NOT about memorizing reactions**.

It is the study of how electrons move to find **stability**.

### The Invariant

> **Reactions proceed through the most stable intermediate.**

If you can predict which carbocation, carbanion, or radical is most stable, you can predict the product.

### The Strategy

1. Identify the nucleophile (electron-rich) and electrophile (electron-poor)
2. Draw the arrow from source (Nu) to sink (E⁺)
3. Check if the intermediate is stable
4. The most stable pathway wins

> **Don't memorize "Alcohol + HBr → Alkyl bromide"**
> **Understand: O takes H⁺, becomes good leaving group, leaves, Br⁻ attacks.**

## PAGE 2 — The Language of Organic Chemistry

### Functional Groups (The Vocabulary)

| Group | Structure | Key Reactivity |
|:------|:----------|:---------------|
| Alkane | C−C, C−H only | Unreactive (combustion, halogenation) |
| Alkene | C=C | Addition reactions |
| Alkyne | C≡C | Addition reactions |
| Alcohol | −OH | Nucleophile, can be oxidized |
| Aldehyde | −CHO | Electrophilic C, can be oxidized/reduced |
| Ketone | C=O (internal) | Electrophilic C, reduced only |
| Carboxylic acid | −COOH | Acidic, forms derivatives |
| Amine | −NH₂ | Basic, nucleophilic |
| Halide | −X (F, Cl, Br, I) | Good leaving group |

### Reading Structures

| Representation | What it shows |
|:---------------|:--------------|
| Molecular formula | Total atoms (C₆H₁₂O₆) |
| Structural formula | All bonds drawn |
| Condensed formula | CH₃CH₂OH |
| Skeletal/Line formula | C at vertices, H implied |

---

## PAGE 3 — The Three Effects (The Tools)

### 1. Inductive Effect (I)

Electron withdrawal/donation through σ bonds.

**Electron Withdrawing Groups (−I):**
$$-NO_2 > -CN > -F > -Cl > -Br > -I > -OH > -OR$$

**Electron Donating Groups (+I):**
$$-C(CH_3)_3 > -CH(CH_3)_2 > -CH_2CH_3 > -CH_3 > -H$$

### 2. Resonance Effect (R or M)

Electron delocalization through π system.

**+R (Electron donating by resonance):**
−OH, −OR, −NH₂, −NR₂, −X (halogens)

**−R (Electron withdrawing by resonance):**
−NO₂, −CN, −CHO, −COR, −COOH, −COOR

### 3. Hyperconjugation

σ electrons of C−H bond delocalize into adjacent empty p-orbital.

**Stability order of carbocations:**
$$\text{3° > 2° > 1° > CH}_3^+$$

Each adjacent C−H bond provides stabilization.

---

## PAGE 4 — Carbocation Stability (The Master Key)

### The Stability Order

$$\text{Resonance stabilized} > \text{3°} > \text{2°} > \text{1°} > \text{CH}_3^+$$

### Why This Order?

| Factor | Effect |
|:-------|:-------|
| Resonance | Delocalizes positive charge over multiple atoms |
| Hyperconjugation | Adjacent C−H σ bonds donate electrons |
| Inductive effect | Alkyl groups donate electrons (+I) |

### Special Stable Carbocations

| Type | Structure | Extra stability from |
|:-----|:----------|:--------------------|
| Allylic | CH₂=CH−CH₂⁺ | Resonance with π bond |
| Benzylic | C₆H₅−CH₂⁺ | Resonance with benzene ring |
| Tropylium | C₇H₇⁺ (7-membered ring) | Aromatic (6 π electrons) |

### Unstable Carbocations

| Type | Why unstable |
|:-----|:-------------|
| Vinyl cation (on C=C) | Cannot achieve planarity |
| Aryl cation (on benzene) | Disrupts aromaticity |

---

## PAGE 5 — Carbanion Stability

### The Stability Order (Opposite of Carbocation!)

$$\text{Resonance stabilized} > \text{sp} > \text{sp}^2 > \text{sp}^3$$

### Why This Order?

- sp carbons hold negative charge better (more s-character = closer to nucleus)
- Electron-withdrawing groups stabilize negative charge

### Acidity and Carbanion Stability

The more stable the conjugate base (carbanion), the stronger the acid.

$$\text{Acidity: } \text{Alkyne} > \text{Alkene} > \text{Alkane}$$

### pKa Values to Know

| Compound | pKa | Conjugate base |
|:---------|:----|:---------------|
| H₂O | 15.7 | OH⁻ |
| Alcohol | 16-18 | RO⁻ |
| Alkyne (terminal) | 25 | RC≡C⁻ |
| NH₃ | 38 | NH₂⁻ |
| Alkene | 44 | Vinyl anion |
| Alkane | 50 | Alkyl anion |

---

## PAGE 6 — Free Radical Stability

### The Stability Order

$$\text{3°} > \text{2°} > \text{1°} > \text{CH}_3 \cdot$$

(Same as carbocations — hyperconjugation stabilizes)

### Radical Reactions: The Pattern

1. **Initiation:** Homolytic cleavage creates radicals (needs heat or light)
2. **Propagation:** Chain reaction (radical + molecule → product + new radical)
3. **Termination:** Two radicals combine

### Key Radical Reactions

| Reaction | Condition | Selectivity |
|:---------|:----------|:------------|
| Chlorination | Cl₂, hν | Low selectivity (1° : 2° : 3° = 1 : 3.8 : 5) |
| Bromination | Br₂, hν | High selectivity (prefers 3°) |
| Allylic bromination | NBS, hν | Substitution at allylic position |

---

## PAGE 7 — Aromaticity

### Hückel's Rule

A compound is aromatic if:
1. Cyclic
2. Planar
3. Completely conjugated (p-orbital on every atom)
4. (4n + 2) π electrons

### The Magic Numbers

| n | 4n + 2 | Examples |
|:--|:-------|:---------|
| 0 | 2 | Cyclopropenyl cation |
| 1 | 6 | Benzene, pyridine, furan |
| 2 | 10 | Naphthalene |
| 3 | 14 | Anthracene |

### Antiaromaticity

4n π electrons in a planar, cyclic, conjugated system → **very unstable**

Example: Cyclobutadiene (4 π electrons) — extremely unstable

### Aromaticity in Ions

| Ion | π electrons | Aromatic? |
|:----|:------------|:----------|
| Cyclopentadienyl anion (C₅H₅⁻) | 6 | Yes |
| Cycloheptatrienyl cation (C₇H₇⁺) | 6 | Yes |
| Cyclopentadienyl cation (C₅H₅⁺) | 4 | Anti-aromatic (unstable) |

---

## PAGE 8 — Reaction Mechanisms: Substitution

### SN1 vs SN2

| Feature | SN1 | SN2 |
|:--------|:----|:----|
| Mechanism | Two steps (carbocation intermediate) | One step (concerted) |
| Rate law | Rate = k[RX] | Rate = k[RX][Nu⁻] |
| Stereochemistry | Racemization | Inversion (Walden) |
| Substrate preference | 3° > 2° > 1° | 1° > 2° > 3° (steric) |
| Favored by | Polar protic solvent, weak Nu | Polar aprotic solvent, strong Nu |

### Decision Tree for Substitution

```
Is the substrate 3°?
├── YES → SN1 (can't do SN2, too hindered)
└── NO
    Is it 1° or methyl?
    ├── YES → SN2 (can't do SN1, unstable carbocation)
    └── NO (it's 2°)
        Look at conditions:
        ├── Strong Nu, aprotic solvent → SN2
        └── Weak Nu, protic solvent → SN1
```

---

## PAGE 9 — Reaction Mechanisms: Elimination

### E1 vs E2

| Feature | E1 | E2 |
|:--------|:---|:---|
| Mechanism | Two steps (carbocation) | One step (concerted) |
| Rate law | Rate = k[RX] | Rate = k[RX][Base] |
| Stereochemistry | No requirement | Anti-periplanar required |
| Regioselectivity | Zaitsev (more stable alkene) | Usually Zaitsev |
| Favored by | Weak base, high T | Strong base |

### Zaitsev's Rule

> **The more substituted alkene is the major product.**

(More substituted = more stable)

### Exception: Bulky Bases

With bulky bases (t-BuOK), Hofmann product (less substituted) may form due to steric hindrance.

### Substitution vs Elimination

| Condition | Favors |
|:----------|:-------|
| Strong nucleophile, low T | Substitution |
| Strong base, high T | Elimination |
| 3° substrate | Elimination (SN2 impossible) |

## PAGE 10 — Addition to Alkenes

### The General Pattern

Alkenes are electron-rich (π bond) → attacked by electrophiles.

### Markovnikov's Rule

> **In addition of HX to alkene, H goes to carbon with more H's.**

**Why?** The carbocation forms on the more substituted carbon (more stable).

### Key Addition Reactions

| Reagent | Product | Regioselectivity |
|:--------|:--------|:-----------------|
| HX (HBr, HCl) | Alkyl halide | Markovnikov |
| H₂O/H⁺ | Alcohol | Markovnikov |
| HBr + peroxide | Alkyl bromide | Anti-Markovnikov |
| Br₂ | 1,2-dibromide | Anti addition |
| OsO₄ or KMnO₄ (cold, dilute) | 1,2-diol | Syn addition |
| BH₃ then H₂O₂/OH⁻ | Alcohol | Anti-Markovnikov, syn |
| H₂/Pd | Alkane | Syn addition |

### Anti-Markovnikov Addition

With peroxides (HBr + ROOR), radical mechanism reverses selectivity:
- Radical forms on more stable (substituted) carbon
- Br adds to that carbon → Anti-Markovnikov product

---

## PAGE 11 — Addition to Alkynes

### Similar to Alkenes, but Two Additions Possible

| Reagent | 1 equivalent | 2 equivalents |
|:--------|:-------------|:--------------|
| HX | Vinyl halide (Markovnikov) | Geminal dihalide |
| X₂ | Trans-dihaloalkene | Tetrahalide |
| H₂O/H⁺/Hg²⁺ | Enol → Ketone (tautomerism) | — |
| H₂/Lindlar's cat. | Cis-alkene | — |
| Na/liq. NH₃ | Trans-alkene | — |

### Acidity of Terminal Alkynes

Terminal alkynes (R−C≡C−H) are acidic enough to react with strong bases:

$$RC\equiv CH + NaNH_2 \to RC\equiv C^-Na^+ + NH_3$$

This acetylide ion is a strong nucleophile!

---

## PAGE 12 — Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS)

### The General Mechanism

1. Electrophile (E⁺) attacks benzene → arenium ion (carbocation intermediate)
2. Proton leaves → aromaticity restored

### Common EAS Reactions

| Reaction | Electrophile | Reagents |
|:---------|:-------------|:---------|
| Halogenation | X⁺ | X₂/FeX₃ |
| Nitration | NO₂⁺ | HNO₃/H₂SO₄ |
| Sulfonation | SO₃ | H₂SO₄ (fuming) |
| Friedel-Crafts alkylation | R⁺ | RCl/AlCl₃ |
| Friedel-Crafts acylation | RCO⁺ | RCOCl/AlCl₃ |

### Limitations of Friedel-Crafts

1. Doesn't work with deactivated rings (−NO₂, etc.)
2. Alkylation can give rearranged products (carbocation rearrangement)
3. Polyalkylation possible

---

## PAGE 13 — Directing Effects in EAS

### Activators and Deactivators

| Type | Effect on Rate | Directing | Examples |
|:-----|:---------------|:----------|:---------|
| Activating, o/p-directing | Increase | ortho, para | −OH, −OR, −NH₂, −R |
| Deactivating, o/p-directing | Decrease | ortho, para | −X (halogens) |
| Deactivating, m-directing | Decrease | meta | −NO₂, −CN, −COR, −COOH |

### The Logic

**Ortho/para directors:** Have lone pair or donate electrons → stabilize positive charge at o/p positions.

**Meta directors:** Withdraw electrons → destabilize o/p positions → meta becomes relatively favored.

### Halogens: The Exception

Halogens are deactivating (−I) but o/p-directing (+R).

The +R effect wins in determining position, but −I effect wins for overall rate.

## PAGE 14 — Alcohols

### Classification

| Type | Structure | Example |
|:-----|:----------|:--------|
| 1° | R−CH₂−OH | Ethanol |
| 2° | R₂CH−OH | Isopropanol |
| 3° | R₃C−OH | tert-Butanol |

### Key Reactions

| Reaction | Reagent | Product |
|:---------|:--------|:--------|
| Dehydration | H₂SO₄, heat | Alkene (Zaitsev) |
| Oxidation (1°) | PCC | Aldehyde |
| Oxidation (1°) | KMnO₄/K₂Cr₂O₇ | Carboxylic acid |
| Oxidation (2°) | PCC or K₂Cr₂O₇ | Ketone |
| Oxidation (3°) | — | No reaction |
| With HX | HBr, HCl | Alkyl halide |
| With SOCl₂ | SOCl₂ | Alkyl chloride |
| With PBr₃ | PBr₃ | Alkyl bromide |

### Lucas Test (Distinguishing Alcohols)

ZnCl₂ + conc. HCl:
- 3° alcohol: Immediate turbidity
- 2° alcohol: Turbidity in 5 min
- 1° alcohol: No reaction at room temperature

---

## PAGE 15 — Aldehydes and Ketones

### The Carbonyl Group

$$\ce{C=O}$$ is polarized: C is δ+, O is δ−

→ Carbon is electrophilic (attacked by nucleophiles)

### Nucleophilic Addition Reactions

| Nucleophile | Product |
|:------------|:--------|
| HCN | Cyanohydrin |
| NaHSO₃ | Bisulfite addition compound |
| RMgBr (Grignard) | Alcohol (after hydrolysis) |
| NH₂OH (hydroxylamine) | Oxime |
| NH₂−NH₂ (hydrazine) | Hydrazone |
| 2,4-DNP | 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (test) |

### Aldol Condensation

$$\ce{2 R-CH_2-CHO ->[\text{dilute NaOH}] R-CH_2-CH(OH)-CH(R)-CHO}$$

(β-hydroxy aldehyde, can dehydrate to α,β-unsaturated aldehyde)

### Cannizzaro Reaction

Aldehydes with no α-H undergo disproportionation:
$$\ce{2 HCHO ->[\text{conc. NaOH}] CH_3OH + HCOONa}$$

### The Grignard "One-Two Punch" ($RMgX$) — Superweapon

Grignard reagents are extremely reactive. They want to react **immediately**.

**Order of Preference:**

1. **Acid-Base Reaction (Fastest):** If there is ANY acidic proton (−OH, −NH, −SH, −COOH, C≡CH), Grignard acts as a **Base** and abstracts the proton.
   - $RMgX + H_2O \to R-H + Mg(OH)X$
   - $RMgX + ROH \to R-H + Mg(OR)X$
   - **This KILLS the Grignard reagent!**

2. **Nucleophilic Attack:** Only if NO acidic H is present, Grignard attacks C=O or C≡N.

| Substrate | Product (after hydrolysis) |
|:----------|:---------------------------|
| HCHO (formaldehyde) | 1° Alcohol |
| R-CHO (aldehyde) | 2° Alcohol |
| R₂C=O (ketone) | 3° Alcohol |
| CO₂ | Carboxylic acid |
| Epoxide | Alcohol (2 carbons added) |

> **Always check for acidic Hydrogens FIRST! If present, Grignard dies.**

---

## PAGE 16 — Carboxylic Acids

### Acidity

Carboxylic acids are acidic because the conjugate base (carboxylate) is resonance-stabilized.

### Acidity Order

$$\ce{RCOOH > HOH > ROH > RC#CH > NH_3 > RH}$$

### Effect of Substituents on Acidity

| Substituent | Effect | Example |
|:------------|:-------|:--------|
| −I groups (Cl, NO₂) | Increase acidity | ClCH₂COOH > CH₃COOH |
| +I groups (alkyl) | Decrease acidity | CH₃COOH > HCOOH (exception!) |

**Formic acid exception:** HCOOH is stronger than CH₃COOH due to +I of methyl group.

### The "Ortho Effect" (Rank Separator)

**1. Benzoic Acids:**
Ortho-substituted benzoic acids are **stronger** than meta/para isomers, regardless of the group's nature (electron donating or withdrawing).

| Substituent | Acidity Order |
|:------------|:--------------|
| −CH₃ (EDG) | ortho > para > meta |
| −NO₂ (EWG) | ortho > para > meta |
| −Cl (EWG) | ortho > para > meta |

**Reason:** Steric Inhibition of Resonance (SIR). The −COOH group twists out of plane, breaking resonance with the ring. The −COOH becomes more localized and acidic.

**2. Anilines:**
Ortho-substituted anilines are **weaker** bases than their para isomers.

**Reason:** SIR prevents effective protonation or destabilizes the conjugate acid.

> **The Trap:** Students assume −NO₂ at ortho is most acidifying, but ortho-CH₃ benzoic acid is MORE acidic than para-NO₂ benzoic acid due to SIR!

### Key Reactions

| Reaction | Product |
|:---------|:--------|
| + Alcohol (H⁺ catalyst) | Ester (Fischer esterification) |
| + SOCl₂ | Acid chloride |
| + NH₃, then heat | Amide |
| + LiAlH₄ | 1° Alcohol |
| Decarboxylation (−CO₂) | Hydrocarbon |

---

## PAGE 17 — Carboxylic Acid Derivatives

### Reactivity Order

$$\ce{Acid chloride > Anhydride > Ester > Amide > Carboxylate}$$

(Better leaving group = more reactive)

### Interconversions

```
Acid chloride
    ↓ + H₂O
    ↓ + ROH → Ester
    ↓ + NH₃ → Amide
    ↓ + RCOO⁻ → Anhydride
```

### Key Reactions

**Acid Chloride:**
- Most reactive derivative
- Used to make all other derivatives

**Ester Hydrolysis:**
- Acidic: Reversible, gives acid + alcohol
- Basic (saponification): Irreversible, gives carboxylate + alcohol

**Claisen Condensation:**
$$\ce{2 RCH_2COOR' ->[\text{NaOR'}] RCH_2COCH(R)COOR'}$$
(β-keto ester)

---

## PAGE 18 — Amines

### Classification

| Type | Structure | Example |
|:-----|:----------|:--------|
| 1° | R−NH₂ | Ethylamine |
| 2° | R₂NH | Diethylamine |
| 3° | R₃N | Triethylamine |

### Basicity

$$\ce{R_2NH > RNH_2 > R_3N > NH_3 > ArNH_2}$$

**Why aniline is weak base:** Lone pair is delocalized into benzene ring.

### Key Reactions

| Reaction | Reagent | Product |
|:---------|:--------|:--------|
| Alkylation | RX | Higher amine (problem: overalkylation) |
| Acylation | RCOCl | Amide |
| With HNO₂ (nitrous acid) | NaNO₂/HCl | Depends on amine type |

### Nitrous Acid Test

| Amine type | Product with HNO₂ |
|:-----------|:------------------|
| 1° aliphatic | N₂ gas evolved (alcohol forms) |
| 1° aromatic | Diazonium salt (stable at 0-5°C) |
| 2° | N-nitrosamine (yellow oil) |
| 3° | No reaction (or salt with HNO₂) |

---

## PAGE 19 — Diazonium Salts

### Formation

$$\ce{ArNH_2 + NaNO_2 + 2HCl ->[0-5°C] ArN_2^+Cl^- + NaCl + 2H_2O}$$

### Reactions (Sandmeyer and Related)

| Reagent | Product | Name |
|:--------|:--------|:-----|
| CuCl | ArCl | Sandmeyer |
| CuBr | ArBr | Sandmeyer |
| CuCN | ArCN | Sandmeyer |
| KI | ArI | — |
| H₃PO₂ | ArH | Reduction |
| H₂O, warm | ArOH | — |
| HBF₄, then heat | ArF | Schiemann |

### Coupling Reactions

Diazonium salts couple with activated aromatic rings (phenols, amines) to form azo dyes.

$$\ce{ArN_2^+ + Ar'OH -> Ar-N=N-Ar'OH}$$

(Coupling occurs at para position, or ortho if para is blocked)

## PAGE 23 — Common Traps and Fixes

### Mechanism Traps

| Trap | Fix |
|:-----|:----|
| Drawing arrow from E⁺ to Nu⁻ | Arrow goes FROM electron source TO sink |
| Forgetting carbocation rearrangement | Always check if 2° can become 3° |
| Assuming all alkyl halides do SN2 | 3° never does SN2 (too hindered) |

### Stability Traps

| Trap | Fix |
|:-----|:----|
| "3° carbanion is most stable" | Opposite! 3° carbanion is least stable |
| "All resonance is equally stabilizing" | Equivalent resonance structures contribute more |
| "More substituents = more stable" | True for carbocations, false for carbanions |

### Reaction Traps

| Trap | Fix |
|:-----|:----|
| Confusing Markovnikov/Anti-Markovnikov | Markov: H to more H's. Anti: with peroxides (radical) |
| "Strong acid = good nucleophile" | Often opposite! HI is strong acid but I⁻ is good Nu |
| Forgetting stereochemistry | SN2 = inversion, E2 = anti-periplanar |

### Aromatic Traps

| Trap | Fix |
|:-----|:----|
| "Halogens activate the ring" | No! They deactivate but still direct o/p |
| "−NO₂ directs para because of resonance" | −NO₂ withdraws by resonance, so m-directing |
| Forgetting aromaticity requirement | 4n+2 π electrons, planar, cyclic, conjugated |

## PAGE 26 — Stereochemistry: The 3D Trap

Mechanisms tell you *what* connects. Stereochemistry tells you *how* it points.

### R/S Configuration (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules)

**Step 1:** Assign priorities by atomic number (higher = higher priority)
$$I > Br > Cl > S > F > O > N > C > H$$

**Step 2:** Point lowest priority group (4) **away** from you (dashed line)

**Step 3:** Trace 1 → 2 → 3
- Clockwise = **R** (Rectus/Right)
- Counter-clockwise = **S** (Sinister/Left)

> **Trap:** If group 4 is on a Wedge (coming toward you), **reverse** the answer (R ↔ S)

### Counting Stereoisomers

For a molecule with $n$ chiral centers:

| Case | Formula | Example |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|
| **No symmetry (all different)** | $2^n$ stereoisomers | 3 centers → 8 isomers |
| **Meso compound possible** | $2^{n-1} + 2^{(n/2)-1}$ (if n even) | Tartaric acid: 3 isomers |

**Meso compounds:** Have chiral centers BUT a plane of symmetry → **Optically Inactive**

### Reaction Stereochemistry Rules

| Reaction | Stereochemistry | Rule |
|:---------|:----------------|:-----|
| SN2 | Inversion | R → S (or S → R) |
| SN1 | Racemization | 50% R, 50% S |
| E2 | Anti-periplanar | H and leaving group on opposite sides |

### Addition Stereochemistry

| Addition Type | Cis Alkene | Trans Alkene |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-------------|
| **Syn** (OsO₄, H₂/Pd) | Meso | Racemic |
| **Anti** (Br₂, epoxidation) | Racemic | Meso |

> **"CAS" Rule:** **C**is + **A**nti = r**A**cemic → Swap letters = **TAS** gives Meso
> **"CSM" Rule:** **C**is + **S**yn = **M**eso → Swap = **TSM** gives Racemic

### Optical Activity

| Condition | Result |
|:----------|:-------|
| Pure R or pure S | Optically active |
| Racemic mixture (50:50 R:S) | Optically inactive |
| Meso compound | Optically inactive (internal compensation) |
