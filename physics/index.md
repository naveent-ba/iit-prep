# Physics
{: .text-blue-300 }

**What Stays Constant:** Energy, Momentum, Angular Momentum, Charge

Physics is the study of **what nature refuses to change**. When you find the conserved quantity, the problem solves itself.

> **Two ways to solve any problem:**
> 1. **Track what's conserved** (Energy, Momentum) — often faster
> 2. **Trace forces step by step** (F = ma) — always works
