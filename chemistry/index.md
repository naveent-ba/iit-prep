**What Stays Constant:** Stability of intermediates, Coulomb's Law ($q/r^2$), Mass & Charge

Chemistry has three personalities — each requires a different approach:

| Branch | The Game | The Invariant |
|:-------|:---------|:--------------|
| **Physical** | The Accountant | Conservation & Equilibrium |
| **Inorganic** | The Architect | Coulomb's Law ($q/r^2$) |
| **Organic** | The Lawyer | Stability of Intermediates |
